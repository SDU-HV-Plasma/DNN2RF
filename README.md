# The Deep Neural Network for Radio Frequency Discharges
The deep neural network with a universal hidden layer structure is developed to explore the discharge characteristics of atmospheric radio frequency discharges. The discharge characteristics such as voltage, electron density, ion density, electric field and electron temperature of atmospheric radio frequency discharges can be quickly predicted by means of the deep neural network. The computational results show that, for a given training set, the constructed deep neural network can describe the properties of atmospheric radio frequency discharges with almost the same accuracy as the fluid model. Also, the computational efficiency of the deep neural network is much higher than that of the fluid model. In addition, the use of the deep neural network can also greatly extend the calculation range of parameters.
